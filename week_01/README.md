I am Ayako Watanabe, a second-year MSCAPP student at the University of Chicago. I have worked for the Ministry of Finance, Japan, for six years. My current interest lies in the intersection between computational analysis and social science research. I spent my childhood in various countries, including Singapore, France, South Korea, and the UK, and began to love "borderless languages," which are Math, Science, Music, and Art to me. I am excited to learn Data Visualization as a means of communication.
