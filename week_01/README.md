Data Selfie from [How to draw your own selfie â€” using your personal data](https://ideas.ted.com/how-to-draw-your-own-selfie-using-your-personal-data/)

I am Ayako Watanabe, a second-year MSCAPP student at the University of Chicago. After graduating from the University of Tokyo, majoring in Agricultural Science, I worked for the Ministry of Finance, Japan, for six years. My current interest lies in the intersection between computational analysis and social science research. I spent my childhood in various countries, including Singapore, France, South Korea, and the UK, and began to love "borderless languages," which are Math, Science, and Art to me. I am excited to learn Data Visualization as a means of communication. Please refer to the Data Selfie to understand my personal character!
