# Week 6

This week, we worked on D3.js to create histogram and scatter plots.

## Class exercise

- [`symbols.html/js`](https://ayakow1.github.io/CAPP30239_FA22/week_06/symbols/symbols.html): scatter plot of Penguins Weight by Flipper Length with symbols and voronoi
- [`histogram-filter.html/js`](https://ayakow1.github.io/CAPP30239_FA22/week_06/histogram/histogram-filter.html): histogram of Weather by Month (Chicago 2022) with filter
- [`stackedbar.html`](https://ayakow1.github.io/CAPP30239_FA22/week_06/stacked/stackedbar.html): stacked bar chart of Fruit Macros
- [`stackedbar.html`](https://ayakow1.github.io/CAPP30239_FA22/week_06/stacked/horizontal-bar.html): horizontal stacked bar chart of Veggie Burrito Macros
- [`ring.html/js`](https://ayakow1.github.io/CAPP30239_FA22/week_06/ring/ring.html): ring chart of Expenses for 2022
- [`multiring.html/js`](https://ayakow1.github.io/CAPP30239_FA22/week_06/ring/multiring.html): ring chart of Expenses by year

## Build Three Charts Assignment

[Fatal Police Shooting](https://ayakow1.github.io/CAPP30239_FA22/week_06/Assignment/index.html)

In 2015, over 1,500 people were shot and killed by police officers in the US. In order to reveal the story of fatal police shooting, we made use of stacked histogram chart, calendar chart and line chart to show victims by age and gender; victims by day and victims by race. Stacked histogram chart enables clear comparison between different groups. Calendar provides a new perspective in terms of how many shootings happened each day. Line chart enables us to dig deep into potential racial discrimination behind shooting. Based on the result, we would propose that it might be helpful to further look into victims by race in proportion to the total population of that race.
