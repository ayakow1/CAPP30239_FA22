          >Population Projection oj Japan (2017)</a
        >, <b>15%</b> of the population of Japan is projected to decrease
        significantly, and the number of people above 60 years old will be
        <b>43%</b> by 2045. The main reasons are the closed policy for immigrants
        and the declining fertility rate.
        <br>
        <br>
        In order to address this issue, we visualize the trends of the demographic 
        shift and examine why this projection is reasonable. Scroll down <b>slowly</b> to learn more.

          <h2>The population will dramatically decrease by 2045</h2>
          <p>Based on the population projection in 2017 for 47 prefectures, 
            all areas except for Tokyo and Okinawa will experience a population decline after 2020. 
            Japan's capital and largest city, Tokyo, maintains its population by absorbing people from other areas. 
            The southernmost prefecture, Okinawa, is an exceptional prefecture with a high fertility rate and an 
            inflow of immigrants from foreign countries.
            <br>
            <br>
            However, the population in Tokyo and Okinawa will also decrease by 2045. 
            In 2045, the population decrease rate compared to 2020 is 15% for the country average. 
            Akita, located in the northern region of Japan, has the nation's highest drop rate (37%), while Tokyo has the lowest (1%). 
            <br>
            <br>
            The shrinking of the population is likely to widen the economic and demographic gaps 
            between rural and city areas.
            <br>
            <br>

        <div class="step" data-step="1">
          <h2>Japan will become a super-aging country</h2>
          <p>The problem resides not only in the total population but also in the demographic age composition. 
            Japan is already known for having the world's highest percentage of older people. 
            The population projection indicates that this trend will accelerate even more.
            <br>
            <br>
            Comparing the number of people between 2020 and 2045 by age groups, 
            we will notice that the significant decrease in young people contributes 
            to a higher percentage of people above 60, from 34.8% in 2020 to 43.4% in 2045.
            <br>
            <br>
            The consequences of the super-aging society are unpredictable, 
            as they have never happened in human history. 
            For example, the current tax and social security systems designed to 
            redistribute wealth from the working-age generation to the old generation are at risk. 
            Besides, the increasing workforce shortage will hamper economic growth even more.
            <br>
            <br>
            Next, we will discuss two significant factors - 
            immigration and fertility rate  - which determine population growth. 
            <br>
            <br>
          </p>
        </div>
        <div class="step" data-step="2">
          <h2>Few immigrants in Japan</h2>
          <p>
            Japan has fewer foreign residents than other OECD countries due to a historic 
            closed-form immigration policy. Pressured by a labor shortage in several industries, 
            the Japanese government recently reformed its immigration policy to attract new foreign workers. 
            <a href="https://www.stat.go.jp/info/today/pdf/180.pdf">The Population Census (2020)</a> reported 
            that the foreign population has increased by 43.6% from 2015 to 2020.
            <br>
            <br>
            However, there is little room for optimism. The foreign population still accounts for a small proportion 
            of the total population (1.9% in 2020). The population projection in 2017 estimates that Japan needs an 
            influx of 750,000 immigrants per year to avoid population shrinkage. 
            Nevertheless, Japan's latest migration inflow was 85,000 
            (<a href="https://www.oecd-ilibrary.org/social-issues-migration-health/international-migration-outlook-2022_30fe16d2-en">
            OECD's International Migration Outlook 2022</a>). 
            <br>
            <br>
            Therefore, unless something unexpected happens, the future of Japan's population heavily relies 
            on current Japanese nationals. 
            <br>

        <div class="step" data-step="3">
          <h2>Fertility rates are low in Tokyo area</h2>
          <p>
            The total fertility rate (TFR) is the average number of children per woman aged 15-49. 
            In 2017, Japan's fertility rate was 1.43, below the 
            <a href="https://data.oecd.org/pop/fertility-rates.htm">OECD countries' average (1.66)</a>. 
            <br>
            <br>
            The low fertility rate is typical in urbanized countries. This trend can be observed even within a nation. 
            Among Japan's three major metropolitan areas (Tokyo, Osaka, Nagoya) <sup>*</a></sup>, 
            the Tokyo area is the largest metropolitan with least birth rate. Conversely, 
            prefectures not in metropolitan areas generally have higher fertility rates than the national average.
            <br>
            <br>
            We plotted the relationship between the fertility rate and the price index on the right-hand side. 
            The price index is one of the indicators of urbanization. We can notice its negative correlation 
            with the birth rate. This chart does not necessarily indicate the economic reason is the cause of 
            the falling fertility rate. Still, there should be some social and economic factors in cities that 
            make people reluctant to have many children. 
            <br>
            <br>
            <small><sup>*</a></sup> Tokyo area (Tokyo, Kanagawa, Saitama, Chiba), Nagoya area (Aichi, Gifu, Mie), 
                and Osaka area (Osaka, Hyogo, Kyoto, Nara). All prefectures are included in other area. </small>
            <br>
            <br>
          </p>
        </div>
        <div class="step" data-step="4">
          <h2>People are moving to Tokyo area</h2>
          <p>
            One factor contributing to the lower fertility rate is overpopulation in the Tokyo area. 
            Over the past decades, Tokyo has absorbed people from rural areas as it long serves as 
            an economic, cultural, and political hub.
            <br>
            <br>
            As we saw in the last scatter plot, the Tokyo area had a lower fertility rate than any other 
            region in Japan. Therefore, the more women move to Tokyo, the fewer children are expected. 
            Furthermore, as the first choropleth maps showed, prefectures other than Tokyo (and Okinawa) 
            are estimated to drop their population. If the economic or demographic gaps continue to widen, 
            it will be increasingly challenging to reverse this migration trend.
            <br>
            <br>
            Then, a certain question arises. Do people not wish to have more children as they decide to move to Tokyo? 
            If they do not want more kids, Japan should start thinking of a way to live with a small population. 
            However, it turns out people are actually hoping to have more babies; Japan's desired fertility rate 
            <sup>*</a></sup> is 1.8, much higher than the actual fertility rate (1.43). 
            <br>

                “Desired birthrate” is defined as the birthrate calculated on assumption that young people can 
                fulfill their desires above as well as in some conditions.</a></small>

          <h2>
            Wives are more engaged in household activities and child care than
            their husbands
          </h2>
          <p>
            Japan's gender role expectation is one of the reasons to prevent women from having children. 
            According to the <a href="https://www.weforum.org/reports/global-gender-gap-report-2022/">Gender gap report (2022)</a>, 
            Japan ranks 116th out of 146 countries. 
            <br>
            <br>
            Over the generation, the number of working women has been increasing due to 
            social and economical reasons. 
            Nevertheless, Japan's traditional women's role in caring for their family 
            and household work remains influential. 
            <br>
            <br>
            The right-hand side chart is based on a survey of how married couples with 
            children spend one day. Even in both-working cases, wives spend more time on 
            household activities and child care than their husbands. As their child gets 
            older, the amount of time for family remains unchanged, substituting child care 
            with household activities. Feel free to use radio buttons to change the woman's 
            working status and the age of the last child.
            <br>
            <br>
            Without having enough support for raising children from men or the government, 
            women face challenges in pursuing both working and having desired family styles, 
            including the number of children.

          <h2>How reliable are the projections?</h2>
          <p>
            So far, we have discussed the population decline based on the estimates from the population projection 
            conducted in 2017. However, we did not examine the appropriateness of projection itself. 
            Lastly, we compare the actual data to past population projections to see the reliability of past predictions.
            <br>
            <br>
            The bold line is the actual data, and the dashed lines are projections released each year 
            (1997, 2002, 2006, 2012, 2017). The above chart shows the actual population slightly outperformed the past estimates, 
            but the declining trend seems to have started as anticipated. The chart below displays the actual fertility rates 
            and those estimated and used as assumptions to derive population predictions. The fertility rate slightly 
            improved from 2005 to 2015 but declined again recently.
            <br>
            <br>
            Hence, Japan's falling population seems inevitable, at least for the near future. 
            As we mentioned before, we cannot fully prospect what will happen in the shrinking population society. 
            The Japanese government is attempting to take action from both sides, increase the population 
            and prepare for a super-aging society. Although Japan will be the first to tackle this issue, 
            some other developed nations will follow a similar trend. As 
            <a href="https://www.imf.org/en/Publications/fandd/issues/2020/03/shrinkanomics-policy-lessons-from-japan-on-population-aging-schneider">experts at IMF</a>
             argued, Japan will be a "world's laboratory" for the aging and contracting population.

        <p class="building">
           <b>Topic selection: </b> I decided to focus on population shrinkage in Japan because 
           it was the most frequently discussed and critical issue while working in the Japanese government. 
           Besides, I observed that despite the importance of topics, the problem was rarely discussed in 
           international media with clear data visualization. Therefore, I constructed the story by introducing 
           the latest population projection with supporting information to tell why Japan is at stake.
           <br> 
           <b>Data collecting: </b> I could quickly identify the data sources from the government's website based on my work experience. 
           However, since most of the data are available in .xlsx files, 
           it took time to convert to Python-friendly format.
           <br>
           <b>Data cleaning: </b> I struggled to figure out what kind of data structure is useful in D3.js. 
           I ended up changing the data structures for each chart based on available examples.
           <br>
           <b>Chart building: </b> First, I drew choropleth maps because it is visually appealing to see 
           how dramatically the population will decrease in each area. 
           Second, I chose a (Cleveland) dot plot instead of a bar chart to show the histogram of the population 
           in each category (age) as it is more clear and possible to reduce data-ink to compare 
           the data points between two years (2020 and 2045). 
           Third, I used a ring chart to show the percentage of foreign residents in Japan's total population. 
           Since there are only three categories, the ring chart is relatively easy to observe the proportion 
           of each element. 
           Fourth, I implemented a scatter plot to examine the correlation between the price index and the fertility rate. 
           I also made use of colors and symbols to show the area categories. 
           Fifth, I made an area chart to plot the time trend of net migration. 
           I filled the areas between the x-axis and the lines with colors because they could emphasize the volume of migrations. 
           Sixth, I built stacked-area charts inspired by Amanda Cox's work 
           (<a href="https://us.gestalten.com/blogs/journal/visualizing-a-new-new-york-times">How employed and unemployed spend their day?</a>). 
           I added radio buttons to be able to switch the chart interactively. 
           At last, I plotted multi-line graphs to compare the time-trend of population and fertility rate in each category.
           <br>
           <b>Putting together: </b> Probably the most challenging part was to lay out all the charts in one article. 
           It was difficult to understand the CSS layout syntax and its hierarchical structure. 
           I used a sticky CSS layout with the scrollama library to align texts and graphs next to each other. 
           This way, the readers can focus on each chart and refer to the text. However, due to the limitation 
           of the library, the chart might break if the users scroll down too fast. 
           I also put effort into making the chart consistent by using the same colors, fonts, and sizes. 
           I used 12 colors from <a href="https://colorbrewer2.org/?type=qualitative&scheme=Paired&n=12">
           Color Brewer
           </a> to represent various categories in each chart. 
           <br>
           <b>Limitations: </b> This project is mainly based on the latest data from 2017. 
           Therefore, I could not reflect the COVID-19 influence on the future population. 
           Since the pandemic is likely to deter people from having children, the following projection 
           is expected to have worse results. Another limitation is that I could not improve the web accessibility enough. 
           For example, the stacked-area chart had to use various colors to represent 12 categories. 
           Thus, it was not easy to introduce an appropriate contrast ratio. 
           To reduce data-ink, I also made use of tooltips, which may be inaccessible to people who use screen readers.
           <br>
           <br>
           Through this project, I learned how flexible the D3.js is, allowing me to draw charts precisely as I wished. 
           It was also an excellent opportunity to learn web development with HTML/CSS. Last but not least, 
           plenty of beautiful data visualization I saw in the class motivated me to achieve this project. 
           I appreciate professor Tiffany France and Sandy Ng for all their support.
