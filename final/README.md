# [Final Project - Shrinking Population in Japan](https://ayakow1.github.io/CAPP30239_FA22/final/index.html)
According to Population Projection oj Japan in 2017, 
15% of the population of Japan is projected to decrease significantly, 
and the number of people above 60 years old will be 43% by 2045. 

In this project, I built multiple charts to tell Japan's demographic shift 
with some supporting data. All of the codes are written in D3.js, HTML, and CSS.
