# Final Project - Shrinking Population in Japan
According to Population Projection oj Japan in 2017, 
15% of the population of Japan is projected to decrease significantly, 
and the number of people above 60 years old will be 43% by 2045. 

In this project, I built multiple charts to tell Japan's demographic shift 
with some supporting data. All of the codes are written in D3.js, HTML, and CSS. 

Please visit [here](https://github.com/ayakow1/CAPP30239_FA22/tree/main/data) to see cleaned data and sources.  

## Codes: 
- `index.html`: main html file for the website. 
- `style.css`: main css file for the website styles. 
- `script.js`: wrapping js file for creating svg and scrolling interaction. 
- `map.js`: js file for building choropleth map. 
- `d3-color-.js`: copied from [Observables](https://observablehq.com/@d3/color-legend)
