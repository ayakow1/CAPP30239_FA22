# Week 4

This week, we worked on D3.js to create line charts.

## Class exercise

- `line.html`/`line.js`: Line chart of Interest Rates by Year (US)
- `area.html`/`area.js`: Area chart of Interest Rates by Year (US)
- `multiple.html`/`html.js`: Multiple line chart of Interest Rates by Year (G7)

## Homework

This line chart uses long-term-interest-canada.csv which shows change of monthly interest rates over time. Source: (OECD)[https://data.oecd.org/interest/long-term-interest-rates.htm#indicator-chart]

- `homework.html`/`homework.js`: Area chart of Interest Rates by Year (Canada)
